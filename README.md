# 3ds-Max-TopoTools-2020
TopoTools 2020 plugin for Autodesk 3ds Max version 2020 or later.

This plugin exposes a number of C++ functions to 3ds Max 2020.

All releases include a script based UI tool that makes use of these functions.

Due to the complexity involved, it would be best to instead skim the packed readme instead of this file.

To see the full readme, please open "usermacros/MXTopoTools/Readme.html" after downloading a realease.
It explains the purpose of the plugin, and gives detailed instructions for its installation and usage.
